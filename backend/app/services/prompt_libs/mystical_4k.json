    "Astrological mystical scene blending pre-Raphaelite elegance, Byzantine sacred geometry, and visionary art. A celestial atmosphere with soft iridescent lighting, dreamlike textures of velvet, gold mosaic, and fractal patterns. Centered is a radiant mandala with planetary glyphs (Moon, Neptune, Chiron, Pluto), surrounded by floating tarot cards and mythological archetypes (Isis, Orpheus, Prometheus). Visual mantras and poetic fragments glow subtly in the air — “Tat Tvam Asi”, “We are made of star-stuff”, “Souviens-toi de qui tu es”. The ambiance evokes introspection, cosmic unity, and metaphysical emotion. Sacred symbols, astrological charts, and zodiac wheels integrated in a seamless spiritual composition. Ultra-detailed, ethereal, metaphysical aesthetic, 4K resolution."
